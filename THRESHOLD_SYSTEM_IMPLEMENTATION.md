# VendorSync Threshold Notification & Ordering System

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive threshold notification and ordering system for the VendorSync application. The system allows vendors to set threshold levels for their products and receive notifications when stock reaches critical levels, with the ability to quickly place orders and view product reports.

## System Architecture

### 1. Enhanced Data Models

#### StockItem Model Enhancements
- **thresholdLevel**: Integer value representing the stock level at which notifications should be triggered
- **thresholdNotificationsEnabled**: Boolean to enable/disable threshold notifications for specific products
- **lastThresholdAlert**: Timestamp of the last threshold alert sent
- **suggestedOrderQuantity**: Calculated order quantity based on historical data

#### New Threshold Status Enum
```dart
enum ThresholdStatus {
  normal,    // Stock is above threshold
  info,      // Stock is running low
  warning,   // Stock has reached threshold
  critical   // Stock is critically low
}
```

#### Enhanced Notification Model
- **productName**: Product name for threshold notifications
- **stockLevel**: Current stock level when notification was created
- **thresholdLevel**: Threshold level that triggered the notification
- **actionData**: Additional data for quick actions (supplier info, suggested quantity)

### 2. New Screens Added

#### A. Threshold Management Screen (`/vendor-threshold-management`)
**Purpose**: Centralized management of threshold levels for all products

**Features**:
- View all products with their current stock levels
- Set and update threshold levels for each product
- Enable/disable threshold notifications per product
- Visual indicators for threshold status (normal, warning, critical)
- Quick access to product reports and ordering
- Stock level progress bars with percentage indicators

**Key Components**:
- Product cards with threshold status chips
- Threshold level editing dialogs
- Notification toggle switches
- Quick action buttons (Edit Threshold, Order Now)

#### B. Quick Order Screen (`/vendor-quick-order`)
**Purpose**: Streamlined ordering process from threshold notifications

**Features**:
- Pre-filled product information from threshold alerts
- Suggested order quantities based on historical data
- Supplier selection with primary supplier auto-selection
- Simplified form with essential fields only
- Direct integration with notification system

**Key Components**:
- Product information display
- Quantity input with suggestions
- Supplier selection radio buttons
- Delivery date picker
- One-click order placement

### 3. Enhanced Existing Screens

#### A. Notifications Screen
**New Features**:
- Color-coded notifications based on type (critical=red, warning=orange, info=blue)
- Quick action buttons for threshold notifications
- "View Reports" and "Order Now" buttons
- Enhanced notification cards with action data
- Long-press options for threshold notifications

#### B. Dashboard Screen
**New Features**:
- Automatic threshold alert checking on load
- Integration with threshold management
- Quick access to threshold management screen

#### C. Stock Management Screen
**New Features**:
- Threshold level indicators
- Enhanced stock item model support
- Integration with threshold notifications

### 4. Enhanced Services

#### NotificationService Enhancements
**New Methods**:
- `createThresholdAlert()`: Creates threshold-specific notifications
- `checkThresholdAlerts()`: Monitors all products for threshold violations
- `_calculateSuggestedQuantity()`: Calculates optimal order quantities

**Threshold Logic**:
- **Critical**: Stock ≤ 50% of minimum stock
- **Warning**: Stock ≤ threshold level
- **Info**: Stock ≤ 120% of minimum stock
- **Normal**: Stock > threshold level

**Alert Frequency Control**:
- Maximum one alert per product per 24 hours
- Respects notification enable/disable settings
- Tracks last alert timestamp

### 5. User Flow

#### Threshold Alert Flow
1. **Monitoring**: System continuously monitors stock levels
2. **Detection**: When stock reaches threshold, system creates notification
3. **Notification**: Vendor receives color-coded notification with quick actions
4. **Action**: Vendor can:
   - View product reports to analyze trends
   - Place quick order with pre-filled data
   - Manage threshold settings
   - Dismiss notification

#### Quick Order Flow
1. **Trigger**: Vendor clicks "Order Now" from notification
2. **Pre-fill**: Screen loads with product and supplier information
3. **Review**: Vendor reviews suggested quantity and adjusts if needed
4. **Confirm**: Vendor places order with one click
5. **Notification**: Supplier receives order notification

#### Threshold Management Flow
1. **Access**: Vendor navigates to Threshold Management screen
2. **Review**: Views all products with current threshold status
3. **Configure**: Sets threshold levels and notification preferences
4. **Monitor**: System automatically monitors and alerts based on settings

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates
```javascript
// stock_items collection
{
  // ... existing fields
  thresholdLevel: number,
  thresholdNotificationsEnabled: boolean,
  lastThresholdAlert: timestamp,
  suggestedOrderQuantity: number
}

// notifications collection
{
  // ... existing fields
  productName: string,
  stockLevel: number,
  thresholdLevel: number,
  actionData: {
    productName: string,
    currentStock: number,
    thresholdLevel: number,
    supplierEmail: string,
    supplierName: string,
    suggestedQuantity: number,
    actionType: string
  }
}
```

### Route Configuration
```dart
'/vendor-threshold-management': ThresholdManagementScreen
'/vendor-quick-order': QuickOrderScreen
'/vendor-product-analytics': ProductAnalyticsScreen
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Smart Quantity Suggestions
- Analyzes delivery history from last 30 days
- Calculates average daily usage
- Suggests 2-week supply with 20% buffer
- Falls back to minimum stock if no history

#### 2. Threshold Status Visualization
- Color-coded status indicators
- Progress bars showing stock levels
- Percentage displays
- Visual hierarchy for different alert levels

#### 3. Quick Actions
- One-click ordering from notifications
- Direct navigation to product reports
- Threshold management access
- Supplier selection with favorites

#### 4. Notification Management
- Granular control per product
- Frequency limiting (24-hour cooldown)
- Enable/disable per product
- Action data for context-aware responses

## Benefits

### For Vendors
